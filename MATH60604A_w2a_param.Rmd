## Interpretation of coefficients of the mean model

We consider the linear model
\begin{align*}
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\mathrm{X}_1 + \cdots + \beta_p\mathrm{X}_p + \varepsilon,
\end{align*}
where $\varepsilon$ is a mean zero error term.


### Interpretation of the parameters

- $\beta_0$ is the value when all of $\mathrm{X}_1, \ldots, \mathrm{X}_p$ are zero.
- $\beta_j$ $(1 \leq j \leq p)$ is the mean change of $Y$ when  $\mathrm{X}_j$ increases by one unit, *ceteris paribus*.
  - provided no higher order terms or nonlinear functions of $\mathrm{X}_j$, interactions, etc.

## `intention` data

-  In a study performed at Tech3Lab, subjects navigated a website that contained, among other things, an advertisement for candies.
- During the site navigation, an eye-tracker measured the location on the screen on which the subject's eyes were fixated.
- The tracker also recorded whether the subject looked at the ad and for how long it was in sight.
- A facial expression analysis software (FaceReader) was used to guess the subject's emotions when the ad was in sight. 
- At the end of the study, a questionnaire measured the subject's intention to buy this type of candy and sociodemographic variables.

---

## Study objectives

Evaluate whether 

1. there is a link between the duration of fixation on the advertisement and the intention to buy and 
2. whether perceived emotion is linked to the intention to buy. 


Only the 120 subjects that had seen the ad in question are included in the data `intention`.

---

## Data description

-  `intention`:  discrete variable ranging between `2` and `14`; larger values indicate higher interest in buying the product. Specifically, the score was constructed by summing the response of two questions, both measured using a Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (`1`) to strongly agree (`7`).
-  `fixation`: the total duration of fixation on the ad (in seconds).
-  `emotion`: a measure of reaction during fixation; the ratio of the probability of showing a positive emotion to the probability of showing a negative emotion.

---

-  `sex`: sex of subject, either man (`0`) or woman (`1`).
-  `age`: age (in years).
-  `marital`: civil status, either single (`0`) or in a relationship (`1`).
-  `revenue`: categorical variable indicating the subject's annual income; one of 
(`1`) $[0,  20\ 000]$;
(`2`) $[20\ 000,  60\ 000]$;
(`3`) $60\ 000$ and above.
-  `educ`: categorical variable indicating the highest educational achievement, either
(`1`) high school or lower;
(`2`) college;
(`3`) university degree.

## Exploratory data analysis

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[**SAS** code]
```{sas, eval = FALSE}
proc means data=statmod.intention mean std min max maxdec=2;
var intention sex age marital fixation emotion;
run;

proc freq data=statmod.intention;
tables intention revenue educ;
run;

 *Repeat this for other variables;
proc sgplot data=statmod.intention;
histogram intention emotion;
run;

```
]

.panel[.panel-name[SAS output (1)]

```{r intention_EDA_1, echo = FALSE, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/c2/slides3-e1.png')
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[SAS output (2)]

```{r intention_EDA_2, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/c2/slides3-e2.png')

## Regression terminology

- **response variable** ( $Y$ ): variable of interest
- **explanatory** variables, **covariates** or **predictors** ( $\mathbf{X}$ ): the variables that are potentially associated with $Y$.


In our example,

- the response variable $Y$ is `intention`;
- the explanatory variables are $\mathbf{X}$: `fixation`, `emotion`, `sex`, `age`, `revenue`, `educ`, `marital`.


We want to measure the effect of `fixation` and `emotion` on the `intention` to buy, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables.

---

### Simple linear regression

Consider a linear model with $\texttt{fixation}$ as only covariate.

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[**SAS** code]

```{sas, eval = FALSE}
proc sgplot data=statmod.intention noautolegend;
scatter y=intention x=fixation;
reg y=intention x=fixation;
yaxis label="buying intention";
xaxis label="fixation time (in seconds)";
run;

proc glm data=statmod.intention;
 *Only print coefficients table;
ods select ParameterEstimates;
model intention=fixation;
run;
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[Scatterplot]

```{r intention_EDA_3, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/c2/slides3-e3b.png')
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Parameter estimates]

```{r intention_fixation, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/c2/slides3-e5.png')
```

The fitted regression line is 

\begin{align*}
\widehat{\texttt{intention}} = 6.45 + 1.14 \texttt{fixation}
\end{align*}

Caveats?
]
]

---



<!-- -  **slope** $\widehat{\beta}_1=1.14$: for every additional second of \texttt{fixation}, the intention score increases *on average* by $1.14$. The longer a person fixates on an ad, the higher their intention of buying the product. -->
<!-- -  **intercept** $\widehat{\beta}_0=6.45$: the mean intention score for individuals who did not look at the ad (i.e., when $\texttt{fixation}=0$)  (but only people who looked at the ad were included in the dataset). -->

<!-- Caveats? (consider the fitted value for $\texttt{fixation}=7$). -->



## Specification of categorical variables in **SAS**

- The **SAS** command `class` creates categorical variables that are interpreted as collection of indicators by the software.
- The baseline category is specified using `ref`. 
- The **SAS** default is the first value encountered.
- In **R**, the analog is `factor`; the baseline is the first value in alphabetical or numerical order.

## Binary explanatory variable

Consider a linear model with $\texttt{sex}$ as only covariate.


.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[**SAS** code]

```{sas, eval = FALSE}
proc glm data=statmod.intention;
ods select ParameterEstimates;
model intention=sex;
run;

/* If not coded 0/1, use class command */
proc glm data=statmod.intention;
class sex(ref="0");
model intention=sex / ss3 solution;
run;
```

]


.panel[.panel-name[Parameter estimates]

The postulated model is
\begin{align*}
\texttt{intention} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \texttt{sex} + \varepsilon
\end{align*}

```{r e6, out.width = '55%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/c2/slides3-e6.png')
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Interpretation]

-  The mean intention to buy for men is $7.55$ points
-  The mean intention to buy for women is $8.92$ points.
-  The estimate of the slope is $\widehat{\beta}_1=1.37$, so the mean intention to buy score is $1.37$ units higher for women than for men. 

]
]

## Categorical explanatory variables

-  The variables $\texttt{revenue}$ and $\texttt{educ}$ are categorical, each with three levels.
-  A categorical variable with $k$ levels requires $k-1$ explanatory variables $\mathbf{X}$ in the model. For example, consider
  -  `educ1 = 1` if $\texttt{educ = 1}$ and zero otherwise.
  -  `educ2 = 1` if $\texttt{educ = 2}$ and zero otherwise.

Because the model includes an intercept, we don't need a third variable, since it would be redundant

|`educ` | intercept | `educ1` | `educ2`|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `1` | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| `2` | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ |
| `3` | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ |

-  When $\texttt{educ}=3$ (baseline), both indicator variables are zero. 

---

## **SAS** code to fit the model with dummies

To fit the model, we include the two indicator variables in place of $\texttt{educ}$.


.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[**SAS** code (1)]

```{sas, eval = FALSE}
data intention; 
set statmod.intention; 
educ1=(educ=1); 
educ2=(educ=2); 
run;

proc glm data=intention; 
ods select ParameterEstimates;
model intention=educ1 educ2; 
run;

 /* Alternative way with `class` */
proc glm data=statmod.intention; 
ods select ParameterEstimates;
class educ(ref="3"); 
model intention=educ / ss3 solution; 
run;
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[SAS output (1)]


```{r e7, out.width = '55%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/c2/slides3-e7.png')
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[SAS output (2)]


```{r e8, out.width = '55%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/c2/slides3-e8.png')
```


The results are identical to those obtained by creating the indicator variables by hand.

]
]

## Interpretation of the contrasts

-  The estimated means of each of the three groups are $8.77, 8.71$, and $7.11$ for education groups $\texttt{1}$, $\texttt{2}$ and $\texttt{3}$, respectively.
-  We can see that the mean of $\texttt{intention}$ is $1.65$ points higher for $\texttt{educ}=\texttt{1}$ than for $\texttt{educ}=\texttt{3}$, etc.
-  To get the comparison between $\texttt{educ}=\texttt{1}$ and $\texttt{educ}=\texttt{2}$, we would need to refit the model after changing the reference category (exercise).

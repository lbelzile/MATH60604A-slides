### Zoom breakout rooms

A breakout room is used for sessions in small groups.

- Different settings (you can share content/screen).  
- You can ask me for help; I will get a notification.
- I can send everyone messages (pop-up)
- You can't access the history of the chat from the main meeting while in the breakout rooms.
- Please don't leave the breakout room until I instruct you to!
- Your microphone will be muted when you come back.
- When I end the breakout sessions, there is a one minute delay before going back (none if you leave them immediately).


---

## Zoom practice

We will practice Breakout rooms, which are small group session.


**Icebreaking activity**: introduce yourself to classmates and give five facts about yourself, e.g., 
  - I live in Tunisia
  - I am a mountain climber
  - I own a labrador named Daisy
  - I used to work as a photographer
  - I have an engineering background

# Recap of week 1

- Testing procedure
- Central limit theorem
- Graphics
- Exploratory data analysis

--


# Question and answer (Q&A) period

- Raise your hand to ask a question.
  - When asked, unmute yourself
- or post question on the chat.

## Testing

Statistical inference is about drawing conclusion for population based on a representative sample.

--

- Postulate a model (often implicitly)
- Fix hypotheses
- Choose and compute the test statistic
- What if $\mathscr{H}_0$? Figure out expected behaviour of test
    - using asymptotic arguments (central limit theorem)
    - exact distribution (nonparametric tests, small samples)
    - using simulations from the null model (e.g., permutation, bootstrap)

*Often, the null hypothesis is derived by making assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.*

## Graphics

Single variable:

- continuous: .can-edit[ -]
- categorical: .can-edit[ -]

Two variables:

- continuous ${}^2$: .can-edit[ -]
- continuous $\times$ categorical: .can-edit[ -]
- categorical ${}^2$: .can-edit[ -]

### Workshop 

Download the `.zip` folder containing 30 graphs.

- Does the graph tell a story (i.e., is it standalone?)
- What are the variables and the mapping?
- Variable type: is the choice of geometry adequate?
- Is the graph complete? 
- Highlight good features and improvement points

---

### Assignment 1

Pick a graph and repeat this commentary exercise

Good sources include 

- the Twitter handles: 
    - BBC [`@BBCNewsGraphics`]
    - Washington Post [`@PostGraphics`]
    - New York Times [`@nytgraphics`]
    - etc.
- newspaper and magazine 
- data providers, e.g.,  [US Census](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/)

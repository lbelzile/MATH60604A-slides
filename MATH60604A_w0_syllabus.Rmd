.question[
What is the format of the course?
]

--
.pull-left[
At home:
- reading course notes
- slides with videos 
- quiz
- exercises (with solutions)
]

--

.pull-right[
In class:
- weekly summary
- question period
- group workshop and discussions
]

---

.question[
What is the workload for this course?
]

--

- 3 credits = 135 hours of work
- an average of 9 hours per week
- do not estimate the initial time investment:
    - installing required software
    - learning programming basics
    - getting up to speed with prerequisites 

---

.question[
What is the target audience?
]

--

Students enrolled in the Data Science and Business Analytics M.Sc program. 

Students admitted normally have a bachelor in
 - engineering
 - physics or 
 - mathematics.

Basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra is assumed.

---

.question[
What are the prerequisites?
]

--

A first course in probability/statistic covering the following notions:

.pull-left[
+ probability axioms and combinatorics
+ random variables
    + moments (expectation, variance, correlation)
    + discrete distributions: Bernoulli, binomial, Poisson
    + continuous distributions: uniform, exponential, normal
]

.pull-right[
+ descriptive statistics
+ hypothesis tests
+ comparison of means and proportions (one and two samples)
+ simple linear regression
]

---

.question[
Will there be programming?
]

--
.sample-answer[
*Yes*. We will cover the basics of **SAS** (and **R**) to fit models and visualized data.
]
- I will provide code only for exercises and slides.

You must provide your code otherwise for assignments/group projects

- I should be able to reproduce *exactly* your analyses.
- submit as a `.txt` file (otherwise, you won't be able to submit your work on *Zonecours*) 
- use UTF8 encoding 
- follow the instructions for naming scripts/files
(hint: $\neq$ `mycode.sas`)

---

.question[
What software will we use in class?
]

According to the official course outline, **SAS** (Base/Stat). You must install the software on your computer. A tutorial (video recorded) will teach you the basics.

--

- This is the only course in your program that uses this programming language. Why bother with it, then?
.midi[
- comparative advantage if you know multiple programming languages.
- frequently used by business
    - they maintain databases with **SAS**
    - the software costs a lot of money ($ $ $)
    - stable, the company offers support (unlike open source)
    - code legacy blocks evolution towards modern languages (Python, R, etc.)
]

---

I recommand (in particular for Unix system)[ **SAS University Edition**](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) (run using a virtual machine through a web browser)

.center[
```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, alt = "SAS University Edition", out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/intro/SASUE.png")
```
]

.midi[
IT services at HEC provide a copy of the software via their platform for Windows  [(free license, but they charge ~35$ for the download)](https://www.hec.ca/dti/assistance/pedagogie/logiciels_enseignes/Procedure-SAS.pdf).
]

---

### **R**

I am avid support of open-access software and of **R**, a programming language written by the community

 - its free!
 - multi-platform support
 - download from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/)
 - used in the course notes
 - I recommand the IDE [**RStudio**](https://rstudio.com/)
 
---

.question[
What are the prof expectations?
]

--

- Active participation in class: students are expected to be in class (even virtually)
.midi[
- if this is impossible, let me know
- small-group discussions
- ask questions! there is no silly question
]
--

- Autonomy: you are sole responsible for your learning.
.midi[
- stay up to date and do your readings 
- don't stay in the dark: ask questions (to me or your peers)!
]
--

- Feedback: problems or unclear explanations? let me know asap
.midi[
- online semester = friction points (internet connection, lack of human contact, etc.)
- many tools = longer period to adapt to uncharted territory
]
---

# Inclusive and respectful environment

Even if the class is virtual, be respectful. Harassment, discriminatory views, etc. are not tolerated.

--

Let me know if

- I can do something to improve the course experience for you or other students
- a statement or attitude makes you uncomfortable
- your name/prefered pronoun/gender differs from the information provided on *HEC en ligne*
- your performance is affected by external factors: I will do my past to help you or direct you to external resources.

---

# Plagiarism

Please don't. 

.midi[
- if you take and adapt code from elsewhere (e.g., `StackOverflow`), cite your sources!
- you must program yourself your code for individual assignments (discussion with peers is okay, but code sharing, copy paste or similar wording is punishable)
